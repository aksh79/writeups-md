Are overflows just a stack concern?

---
the program prints address and value of two strings allocated on the heap: `save_var` and `input_data` (initialized to `bico` and `pico` respectively). it then gives us 4 options:
- Print Heap
- Write to Buffer (change `input_buffer`)
- Print `safe_var`
- Print Flag
- Exit

the print flag option invokes the following function:
`check_win()`
```C
void check_win() {
    if (strcmp(safe_var, "bico") != 0) {
        printf("\nYOU WIN\n");

        // Print flag
        char buf[FLAGSIZE_MAX];
        FILE *fd = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
        fgets(buf, FLAGSIZE_MAX, fd);
        printf("%s\n", buf);
        fflush(stdout);

        exit(0);
    } else {
        printf("Looks like everything is still secure!\n");
        printf("\nNo flage for you :(\n");
        fflush(stdout);
    }
}
```
this suggests that, we need to modify the `safe_var` variable somehow. 

if we look at the state of the heap, it will tell us that the two variables are allocated adjacent to each other and the `input_data` is allocated before the `safe_var`. the program also uses `scanf` to read `input_data`. which suggests that we can overflow into the `safe_var` variable. we just need provide an input big enough to overflow into the next buffer.
